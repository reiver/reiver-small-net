§ Finger-Protocol

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The **finger-protocol** is an early Internet-based **social-network**,  with its origins in the early 1970s.
Like with a lot of things from the early Internet — the **finger-protocol** is decentralized.

**finger**'ing someone could return:

• personal information,
• contact information,
• references to that person's presence on other parts of the Internet,
• a short biography,
• a journal,
• articles,
• jokes,
• (so called) ASCII art (which could contain non-ASCII characters),
• animations,
• //and more//.

Historically people and even machines were identified by user names at a host name. For example:

``cikrempeaux@reiver.link``

Someone could request information //from// or //about// a **user** at a **host** using one of the historic ``finger`` terminal applications.
On the command-line, a simple finger request could be performed with something like the following:

``finger cikrempeaux@reiver.link``

A finger-protocol server could return anything it wanted.
But the spirit of the finger-protocol is that the output should be **human-legible** first, given what technologies are available at the time (and //programmer-legible// & //machine-legible// second if at all).

Also, being a simple protocol, made creating a simple client often trivial for many.
For example:

``echo '/W cikrempeaux' | nc reiver.link 79``

§§ Small-Net

Nowadays (as the year 2022), the **finger-protocol** is considered a [[small-net]] protocol.
