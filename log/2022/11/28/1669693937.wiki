You could use **finger** as a mirror & a CDN —

The type of [[finger-protocol]] request many are used to —

finger joeblow@example.com 

I.e., ask "example.com" for joeblow's content.

But you could request someone else's from a different server with:

finger joeblow@example.com@reiver.link

I.e., ask "reiver.link" for the content for "joeblow" from "example.com".
