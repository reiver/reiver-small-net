The **small-net** community should move away from Internet domain names.

At least as the primary way of addressing content.

Internet domain names â€”

â€¢ can expire,
â€¢ can be taken away from you,
â€¢ cost you money each year.

This results in URLs breaking â€” which contributes to one of the scourges of the Internet â€” **link-rot** ðŸ”—

We are loosing large parts of human culture, human knowledge, and human history as a result of this!
