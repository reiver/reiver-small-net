§ The Two World Wide Webs

I kind of get the feeling that people are trying to refactor the web, in a sense.

And that there are at least 2 different visions for the future of the Web.

Some seem to want the Web to go back to being about (relatively “dumb”) hypertext document format.

Others seem to want the Web to be about a (relatively “smart”) cross-platform application platform.

(There are other visions for the future of the Web, too.)

❦

This difference between these 2 visions for the future of the Web reminds me of the “M” (i.e., “Model“ ”) and “V” (i.e., “View”) respectively from the [[model-view-control]] (“MVC”) software development pattern.

I.e.,

“Model” ⊃ “(relatively dump) hypertext document format”

“View” ⊃ “(relatively smart) cross-platform application platform”

❦

The ones that want the Web to become a (relatively “dump”) document platform seem to want something like the ‘Model’ from the **model-view-control** software development pattern.

The ones that want the Web to become a (relatively “smart”) cross-platform application platform seem to want something like the ‘View’ from the **model-view-control** software development pattern.

❦

I wonder if these two visions for the future of the Web have to be at-odds with each other ⁠—

The popularity of the **model-view-control** software development pattern suggests that they could be complimentary.
