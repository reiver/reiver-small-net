The Internet is broken.
The Web is broken.
Social Media is broken.

Many people feel this.

❦

You get spied on.
You get tracked.
You get your privacy taken away from you.
You get turned into a product, and sold.
You get your online identity taken from you.
You get censored.
You get manipulated.
You get your source of income taken from you, because it suits someone else's interests.
You get controlled.
You get everything taken away from you.

Did you tap to accept cookies?
Did you tap to join the newsletter?
Did you tap to allow notifications?

It doesn't have to be this way.

The way to fix a lot of this — probably most of this — is straightforward.

Someone just has to decide to do something about it.

Someone has to go ahead and do the actual work to make it happen.

And — someone has to donate their work to the world (and not turn it into a corporation).
Just like the core technologies behind the Internet (TCP, UDP, HTTP(S), etc) were donated to the world.
