If you look at an HTML document that has absolutely no styling in a web-browser (such as Chrome or Firefox) it does not look good for many HTML tags.

If you look at an HTML document that has absolutely no styling in many e-book readers (that support EPUB) they look decent.

It would probably be better for a small-net web-browser to be more like an e-book reader than the major modern web-browsers.

I think most major modern web-browsers are more geared towards using web technologies as a (relatively “smart”) cross-platform application platform.

Where e-book readers (that support EPUB) are more geared towards using web technologies  as a (relatively “dumb”) hypertext document format.
