§ gemtext-format

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The **gemtext**-format is a  [[markup-format]] [[data-format]] used to create [[hyper-text]] documents.

The **gemtext**-format is very closely associated with the [[gemini-protocol]], as it is //the most common way to serve textual content over the [gemini-protocol]]//.

With the exception of //preformatted-text//, the **gemtext**-format is, a line-oriented format.

The **gemtext**-format supports:

• [[block-quotation]]s
• headings (up to three levels)
• paragraphs
• [[preformatted-text]]
• links (but //not// inline links)
• lists (but //not// nested lists)

§§ Links

The **gemtext**-format only supports **links** that are on their own line.

The **gemtext**-format does **not** support (inline) //links// within paragraphs, block-quotations, lists, preformatted-text, or anywhere else.

A **gemtext** link looks like this:

	=> http:/((/))example.com/

Here is another example **gemtext** link that includes some text:

	=> http:/((/))example.com/ An example website

And here is yet another **gemtext** link:

	=> gemini:/((/))example.com/ An example gemini capsule

But also, this too is a link:

	=>http://example.com/ An example website

(Note that the space between the "=>" and the URL is missing with this last example.)
